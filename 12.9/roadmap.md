# Apollo Discord Bot Roadmap.
Hey everyone, we are addressing a few things that will be changing below and will be addressed in a new rewrite for Apollo.

# What's changing?
- We are implementing more slash Commands because Discord wants us too. (This effect won't take place until February.
- We are adding more configurable options for your server, to make your server & our bot, a more experienceable place for all!
- Implemnation of AutoModeration and other stuff etc.

# Moderation Updates:
- Automod: This automod option is configurable which will become available very soon, you can set custom swear words for our bot to catch, and to avoid spam you can enable the "Spam Module" for Apollo.
- Customizable Muteroles: More fun, is you can set your own mute role with our bot using the /setmute command.
- Slash commands will hold more Moderation fun as well!


# Fun Commands: 
- Slash commands have had some weird feedback with specific commands, so you will have to say goodbye to the say command.
- More fun commands include a customizable leaderboard (We'll talk about this in 2022).
- and more!


# Avoidance of bugs.
- This update will clean us out of any bugs possible and will avoid some downtime.



So, yeah. That's basically it for this update, we've been hard at work making it happen. We'll keep you updated.
